Photosynthesis is an amazing process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria capture energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy that they can use to grow and thrive.

It's like their own personal food factory!

Here's the basic rundown of how it works:

1.

Sun's kiss:   Plants absorb sunlight through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata.

2.

Green magic:   Inside the leaves are organelles called chloroplasts, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll.

This chlorophyll acts like a trap, capturing the sun's energy.

Water works:   Plants also take in water through their roots.

4.

Carbon dioxide crunch:   They pull in carbon dioxide from the air through the stomata.

5.

Energy shuffle:   Using the sun's energy captured by chlorophyll, plants combine water and carbon dioxide to make glucose, a type of sugar, in a process called the Calvin cycle.

6.

Oxygen output:   As a bonus, plants release oxygen gas as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

This oxygen is what we breathe!

The glucose made by photosynthesis is the plant's main source of energy.

It can be used immediately for fuel or stored for later.

Plants also use glucose to build other molecules they need, like proteins and cellulose.

Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth.

It's the base of the food chain, providing energy for all herbivores and, indirectly, all carnivores.

It also helps to regulate the atmosphere by removing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.

So, next time you take a bite of a juicy apple or smell a fragrant flower, remember the amazing power of photosynthesis at work!
