I need more context to understand what "it" refers to.

Here are some options:

  If you're asking where the Taj Mahal is, it's located in Agra, India, on the south bank of the Yamuna river.

  If you're asking where the Eiffel Tower is, it's located on the Champ de Mars in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France.

  If you're asking where the Great Wall of China is, it's located in northern China, winding its way east to west across the country.

  If you're asking where the Colosseum is, it's located in central Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum.

Please let me know if any of these are what you're looking for, or if you have another question.
